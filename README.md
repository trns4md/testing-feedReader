# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and included one test suite. I added testing that the RSS feeds to be added to the site correctly, testing to ensure the menu default was hidden/and then visible when clicked, testing that entries were being made, and testing that new content was being added.


## What did I learn?

I learned how to use Jasmine to trouble shoot any issues that might be present.  I now have a better understanding of how to use JavaScript to write tests.
